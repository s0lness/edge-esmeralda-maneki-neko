<h1 align="center">Edge Esmeralda — Maneki Neko</h1>

A little kindness game for Edge Esmeralda. Personal AI agents nudge their humans
into tiny acts of kindness for other attendees: a coffee, a snack, a flower, a
kind word. After Bruce Sterling's [Maneki Neko](https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/maneki-neko/),
the network keeps everyone whole, so if you give, someone comes your way too.

## Are you an agent? Read the skill.

If you are a personal agent whose human is at Edge Esmeralda and you want them to
play, **read [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md)** at the root of this repo. It tells you how to
join your human, set a heartbeat, and run the game on their behalf. That one file
is the whole contract; everything else here is how the coordinator behind it works.

## How it works

- An agent reads [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) and registers its human.
- On a ~30 minute heartbeat the agent checks a central **coordinator** to see if
  it's their turn to give, or whether someone is about to bring them a kindness.
- Matching is deterministic and physical, not semantic: two in-game people who
  both RSVP'd the same upcoming Edge event. No intent graph, no networking.
- A private **ledger** keeps everyone near balance: give today, receive today.

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the full design, the flow, and the open cracks.

## Layout

- `SKILL.md` — the agent skill (voice, flow, endpoints). The canonical copy, at the
  root so agents find it. `skills/maneki/SKILL.md` is an identical copy for plugin
  install; a test keeps them in sync (`npm run sync:skill` after editing the root).
- `.claude-plugin/` — plugin + marketplace manifests, so an agent can install it.
- `src/server.ts` — the HTTP coordinator (the orchestra).
- `src/match.ts` — EdgeOS co-presence matcher + expiry.
- `src/flow.ts` — the poll state machine (what an agent should do this tick).
- `src/state.ts` — the store: players, ledger, pairings.
- `src/edgeos.ts` — EdgeOS events + participants client.
- `src/directory.ts` — optional name -> Telegram lookup (PII, supplied at runtime).
- `tests/` — engine + lifecycle tests.
- `DESIGN.md` — the design doc.

## Coordinator API

- `POST /join {handle, edgeosName, preferences}` -> `{token}`
- `GET  /poll?token=` -> `{role, stage, ...}`
- `POST /accept` · `/identifier` · `/done` · `/confirm` · `/reveal` · `/skip` · `/leave` · `/flag`
- `POST /admin/seed`, `POST /admin/match`, `GET /admin/state` (require `x-admin-token`)
- `GET /stats` (public, no PII)

## Run locally

```
npm install
npm test
cp .env.example .env   # fill in EDGEOS_API_KEY
ADMIN_TOKEN=dev npm start   # serves on :8080
```

## Deploy

`deploy.sh` needs the `gcloud` CLI. Easiest is Google Cloud Shell (gcloud is
preinstalled and already authed): open it from the GCP console, then:

```
git clone https://github.com/s0lness/edge-esmeralda-maneki-neko
cd edge-esmeralda-maneki-neko
printf 'EDGEOS_API_KEY=eos_live_xxx\nEDGEOS_POPUP_ID=43746fd0-bce2-472b-93e4-a438177b2dff\n' > .env
PROJECT=whim-net REGION=europe-west1 ADMIN_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 16) ./deploy.sh
```

This stores the EdgeOS key in Secret Manager and deploys to Cloud Run as a single
warm instance. State persists to a GCS bucket (`MANEKI_GCS_BUCKET`), restored at
boot and snapshotted after every write, so restarts and redeploys don't lose
players or the ledger (keep it at one instance so writes don't race). The script
prints the live URL and the admin token; put the URL in place of
`https://MANEKI_HOST` in `SKILL.md` (then `npm run sync:skill`).

## Status

Live on Cloud Run (whim-net, europe-west1). Engine, coordinator, skill (v2, with
server-driven self-update), plugin scaffold, and GCS persistence are built, tested,
and deployed; the full EdgeOS-presence -> pairing path is verified end to end.
Remaining: rotate the EdgeOS key, then seed the founders.
